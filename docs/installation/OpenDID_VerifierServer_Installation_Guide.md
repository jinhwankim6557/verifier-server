# 4. Server Running Methods

This chapter guides you through three methods to run the server.

Project sources are located under the `source` directory, and you need to load and configure sources from the corresponding directory depending on each running method.

1. **Using IDE**: You can open the project in an Integrated Development Environment (IDE), set up execution configurations, and run the server directly. This method is useful for quickly testing code changes during development.

2. **Using console commands after Build**: After building the project, you can run the server by executing the generated JAR file with console commands (`java -jar`). This method is mainly used when deploying the server or running in production environments.

3. **Building with Docker**: You can build the server as a Docker image and run it as a Docker container. This method maintains consistency across environments and has advantages in deployment and scaling.

## 4.1. Running with IDE (Gradle and React Project Execution)

The Open DID project consists of a backend (Spring Boot-based) and frontend (React-based), which can be developed and executed in IntelliJ IDEA and VS Code respectively.

### 4.1.1. Running Backend (Spring Boot) in IntelliJ IDEA

IntelliJ IDEA is an IDE widely used for Java development and is well compatible with Gradle-based projects. Since the Open DID server uses Gradle, it can be easily executed in IntelliJ.

#### 1. Install IntelliJ IDEA

- [Download IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/)

#### 2. Open Project

- Select `File -> New -> Project from Existing Sources`  
- Select `source/did-verifier-server` directory  
- The `build.gradle` file is automatically recognized, and necessary dependencies are automatically downloaded

#### 3. Gradle Build

- In the `Gradle` tab, execute `Tasks -> build -> build`

#### 4. Run Server

- Execute `Tasks -> application -> bootRun`  
- When the console displays `"Started [ApplicationName] in [time] seconds"` message, it's running normally

> ⚠️ Runs with default `sample` profile. Runs for testing purposes without database  
> For details, refer to [6. Profile Configuration and Usage](#6-profile-configuration-and-usage)

#### 5. Database Installation

- Uses PostgreSQL (Docker installation recommended)  
- For detailed installation methods, refer to [2.2. PostgreSQL Installation](#22-postgresql-installation)

#### 6. Server Configuration

- Configuration file location: `src/main/resources/config`  
- Example: DB connection information, ports settings, etc.  
- For detailed configuration methods, refer to [5. Configuration Guide](#5-configuration-guide)

---

### 4.1.2. Running Frontend (React) in VS Code

The Verifier admin console is React-based and can be executed separately in VS Code. It's useful for frontend development or UI verification.

#### 1. Install VS Code

- [Download VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

#### 2. Open Project

- Open `source/did-verifier-admin` directory in VS Code

#### 3. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

#### 4. Run Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

- Default access URL: [http://localhost:8092](http://localhost:8092)

> 📌 **Note:**  
> The backend (Spring Boot server) must be running separately,  
> and the API server address in the frontend can be specified through the `vite.config.ts` file or configuration files.
   

<br/>

## 4.2. Running with Console Commands

This section guides you through running the Open DID server using console commands. It explains the process of building the project using Gradle and running the server using the generated JAR file.
- When building with Gradle, the frontend (Admin Console) is automatically built together and included as static resources.

### 4.2.1. Gradle Build Commands

- Build the source using gradlew.
  ```shell
    # Move to the source folder of the cloned repository
    cd source/did-verifier-server

    # Grant execution permission to Gradle Wrapper
    chmod 755 ./gradlew

    # Clean build the project (delete previous build files and build new)
    ./gradlew clean build
  ```
  > Note: If frontend build is not needed (e.g., testing backend only or already including frontend artifacts), you can skip frontend build by adding the following option: 
  > - `./gradlew clean build -DskipFrontendBuild=true`

- Move to the built folder and verify that the JAR file is generated.
    ```shell
      cd build/libs
      ls
    ```
- This command generates the `did-verifier-server-2.0.0.jar` file.

<br/>

## 4.3. Running with Docker

- For Docker image building, configuration, execution, and other processes, refer to [7. Building and Running with Docker](#7-building-and-running-with-docker) below.

<br/>

# 5. Configuration Guide

This chapter guides you through all configuration values included in the server's configuration files. Each configuration is an important element that controls the server's operation and environment, and proper configuration is necessary for stable server operation. Please refer to the item-by-item descriptions and examples to apply configurations suitable for each environment.

Settings with the 🔒 icon are generally fixed values or values that typically don't need modification.

## 5.1. application.yml

- Role: The application.yml file defines basic settings for Spring Boot applications. Through this file, you can specify various environment variables such as application name, database settings, profile settings, etc., which significantly impact the application's operation.

- Location: `src/main/resources/`

### 5.1.1. Spring Basic Configuration

Spring's basic configuration defines the application name and profiles to activate, playing an important role in setting up the server's operating environment.

- `spring.application.name`: 🔒
  - Specifies the application name.
  - Purpose: Mainly used to identify applications in log messages, monitoring tools, or Spring Cloud services
  - Example: `Verifier`

  - Defines the profile to activate.
  - Purpose: Selects either sample or development environment to load configurations appropriate for that environment. For detailed profile information, refer to [6. Profile Configuration and Usage](#6-profile-configuration-and-usage).
  - Supported profiles: sample, dev
  - Example: `sample`, `dev`

- `spring.profiles.group.dev`: 🔒
  - Defines individual profiles included in the `dev` profile group.
  - Purpose: Groups and manages settings to be used in development environments.
  - Profile file naming convention: Configuration files corresponding to each profile use the name exactly as defined in the group. For example, the auth profile is written as application-auth.yml, databases profile as application-databases.yml. File names must use exactly the names written under group.dev.

- `spring.profiles.group.sample`: 🔒
  - Defines individual profiles included in the `sample` profile group.
  - Purpose: Groups and manages settings to be used in development environments.
  - Profile file naming convention: Configuration files corresponding to each profile use the name exactly as defined in the group. For example, the auth profile is written as application-auth.yml, databases profile as application-databases.yml. File names must use exactly the names written under group.dev.

<br/>

### 5.1.2. Jackson Basic Configuration

Jackson is the JSON serialization/deserialization library used by default in Spring Boot. Through Jackson configuration, you can adjust JSON data serialization methods or formats, improving performance and efficiency during data transmission.

- `spring.jackson.default-property-inclusion`: 🔒
  - Sets not to serialize when property values are null.
  - Example: non_null

- `spring.jackson.default-property-inclusion`: 🔒
  - Sets not to cause errors when serializing empty objects.
  - Example: false

<br/>

### 5.1.3. Server Configuration

# 6. Profile Configuration and Usage

## 6.1. Profile Overview (`sample`, `dev`)

The Verifier server supports two profiles, `dev` and `sample`, to run in various environments.

Each profile is designed to apply configurations appropriate for the corresponding environment. By default, the Verifier server is set to the `sample` profile, which is designed to run the server independently without integration with external services such as databases or blockchains. The `sample` profile is suitable for API call testing, allowing developers to quickly verify the basic operation of the application. This profile returns fixed response data for all API calls, making it useful in initial development environments.

Sample API calls are written as JUnit tests, so you can refer to them when writing tests.

In contrast, the `dev` profile is designed to perform actual operations. Using this profile enables testing and verification with real data. When the `dev` profile is activated, it integrates with actual external services such as databases and blockchains, allowing you to test application behavior in real environments.

### 6.1.1. `sample` Profile
The `sample` profile is designed to run the server independently without integration with external services (DB, blockchain, etc.). This profile is suitable for API call testing and allows developers to quickly verify the basic operation of the application. Since it returns fixed response data for all API calls, it's useful for initial development stages or functional testing. Because no integration with external systems is required, it provides an environment where you can run and test the server standalone.
> Note: When using the sample profile, the Admin Console will not work.

### 6.1.2. `dev` Profile

The `dev` profile includes configurations suitable for development environments and is used on development servers. To use this profile, configuration for development environment databases and blockchain nodes is required.

## 6.2. Profile Configuration Methods

This section explains how to change profiles for each running method.

### 6.2.1. When Running Server with IDE

- **Configuration File Selection:** Select the `application.yml` file in the `src/main/resources` path.
- **Profile Specification:** Add the `--spring.profiles.active={profile}` option in the IDE's run settings (Run/Debug Configurations) to activate the desired profile.
- **Configuration Application:** The corresponding configuration file is applied according to the activated profile.

### 6.2.2. When Running Server with Console Commands

- **Configuration File Selection:** Prepare profile-specific configuration files in the same directory as the built JAR file or in the path where configuration files are located.
- **Profile Specification:** Add the `--spring.profiles.active={profile}` option to the server running command to activate the desired profile.
  
  ```bash
  java -jar build/libs/did-verifier-server-2.0.0.jar --spring.profiles.active={profile}
  ```

- **Configuration Application:** The corresponding configuration file is applied according to the activated profile.

### 6.2.3. When Running Server with Docker

- **Configuration File Selection:** When creating a Docker image, specify the configuration file path in the Dockerfile or mount external configuration files to the Docker container.
- **Profile Specification:** Set the profile by configuring the `SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE` environment variable in the Docker Compose file or Docker execution command.
  
  ```yaml
  environment:
    - SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE={profile}
  ```

- **Configuration Application:** Configuration is applied according to the specified profile when running the Docker container.

You can flexibly change profile-specific configurations according to each method and easily apply configurations suitable for your project environment.

# 7. Running After Building with Docker

## 7.1. Docker Image Build Method (Based on `Dockerfile`)

### 7.1.1. Build Docker image
Build the Docker image with the following command:

```bash
cd {source_directory}
docker build -t did-verifier-server -f did-verifier-server/Dockerfile .
```

<br/>

## 7.2. Running with Docker Compose

### 7.2.1. Preparing Directories and Configuration Files

#### 1. Create docker-compose directory and config directory
```bash
mkdir -p {docker_compose_directory}/config
```

#### 2. Copy configuration files (yml) to config directory
```bash
cp {application_yml_directory}/* {docker_compose_directory}/config/
cp {blockchain_properties_path} {docker_compose_directory}/config/
```

#### 3. Modify blockchain.properties file
```yml
evm.network.url=http://host.docker.internal:8545
... (omitted)
```

> **host.docker.internal** is a special address that points to the host machine from within a Docker container.  
> Since localhost inside a container refers to the container itself, you must use host.docker.internal to access services (PostgreSQL, blockchain) running on the host.

#### 4. Modify application-database.yml file
```yml
spring:
 ... (omitted)
 datasource:
   driver-class-name: org.postgresql.Driver
   url: jdbc:postgresql://host.docker.internal:5430/verifier
   username: omn
   password: omn
 ... (omitted)
```

### 7.2.2. Create `docker-compose.yml` file
You can easily manage multiple containers using the `docker-compose.yml` file.

```yml
version: '3'
services:
 app:
   image: did-verifier-server
   ports:
     - "8092:8092"
   volumes:
     - {config_directory}:/app/config
   environment:
     - SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE=dev
   extra_hosts:
     - "host.docker.internal:host-gateway"
```

> - In the example above, the `config_directory` is mounted to `/app/config` inside the container to share configuration files.
>   - Configuration files located in `config_directory` take priority over default configuration files.
>   - For detailed configuration instructions, please refer to [5. Configuration Guide](#5-configuration-guide).


### 7.2.3. Run Container
```bash
cd {docker_compose_directory}
docker-compose up -d
```

# 8. Installing Docker PostgreSQL

This section explains how to install PostgreSQL using Docker. Through this method, you can easily install PostgreSQL and integrate it with the server for use.

## 8.1. PostgreSQL Installation using Docker Compose

The following shows how to install PostgreSQL using Docker Compose.

```yml
services:
  postgres:
    container_name: postgre-verifier
    image: postgres:16.4
    restart: always
    volumes:
      - postgres_data_verifier:/var/lib/postgresql/data
    ports:
      - 5432:5432
    environment:
      POSTGRES_USER: ${USER}
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: ${PW}
      POSTGRES_DB: verifier

volumes:
  postgres_data_verifier:
```

This Docker Compose file installs PostgreSQL version 16.4 and makes the following configurations:

- **container_name**: Names the container `postgre-verifier`.
- **volumes**: Mounts the `postgres_data_verifier` volume to PostgreSQL's data directory (`/var/lib/postgresql/data`). This ensures data is permanently preserved.
- **ports**: Maps the host's port 5432 to the container's port 5432.
- **environment**: Sets PostgreSQL's username, password, and database name. Here, `${USER}` and `${PW}` can be set as environment variables.

## 8.2. PostgreSQL Container Execution

To run the PostgreSQL container using the above Docker Compose file, execute the following command in the terminal:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

This command runs the PostgreSQL container in the background. The PostgreSQL server runs according to the configured environment variables, and the database is prepared. You can then proceed with integration settings to use this database in your application.
